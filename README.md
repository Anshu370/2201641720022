Key Architectural Decisions:

* Architecture Style: Monolithic backend with modular structure for controllers, models, and utilities for clarity and maintainability.
* Backend Framework: Node.js with Express.js for handling HTTP requests and routing efficiently.
* Database: MongoDB for flexible schema handling of structured and semi-structured data.
* Environment Configuration: dotenv for secure management of environment variables.

Data Modeling:

* Collections structured to store user requests, logs, and related data.
* Indexes created to optimize query performance.
* Modular model structure for easier expansion and reuse.

Technology Selection Justifications:

* Node.js & Express.js: Lightweight, efficient, and widely used for backend services handling multiple concurrent requests.
* MongoDB: Supports flexible schema design for dynamic data requirements and rapid development cycles.
* dotenv: Keeps sensitive configurations out of the codebase.

Assumptions:

* Multiple API endpoints will be needed for different modules.
* The system must handle moderate to high concurrent traffic efficiently.
* Proper logging is essential for debugging and monitoring.

Maintainability Considerations:

* Modular code with separate directories for controllers, models, and utilities.
* Scalable for future addition of features without major refactoring.
* Clear and consistent coding patterns for easier collaboration and debugging.
